### Basic Plot Generator for Science-Fiction stories and the like

Let's give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar. This page would never have been possible without the original AutoBlurb file from Conrad Cook, available [here](https://sites.google.com/a/conradcook.net/misc/autoblurb). The original file was supposed to be used with another software called Inspiration Pad Pro 2. As it is explicitely written on the website that there is "No copyright or restrictions on this file; no promises either." I used it with a recipe on my own.

If you have a look at the code, you'll be able to see all the included plot possibilities. Knitting the code with RMarkdown into HTML will provide you with a random subset of ideas. And if you don't like it, feel free to re-knit to get another random set!
